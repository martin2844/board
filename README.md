# Knext üöÄ

Welcome to **Knext** - a Next.js starter template that incorporates NextAuth, styled using TailwindCSS, and utilizes SQLite with KNEX for efficient query building. Knext combines the powerful features of these technologies to streamline the setup of Next.js projects.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Next.js** - The React framework for production.
- **NextAuth.js** - Authentication for Next.js.
- **TailwindCSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **SQLite** - A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained SQL database engine.
- **KNEX** - A SQL query builder for JavaScript.

## Getting Started üèÅ

Follow these instructions to get your copy of the starter up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have npm installed on your system. You can install it from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:martin2844/knext.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd knext
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now, your server should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open your browser and visit the address to see your starter in action!

## Database Migrations

This starter uses KNEX for managing database migrations, which helps in version controlling your database schema. Below are the commands available in `package.json` to handle migrations:

- **`npm run migrate:make <name>`**: Create a new migration file with the specified `<name>`. This is where you define changes to your database schema.
- **`npm run migrate:latest`**: Apply all pending migrations to your database. This updates your schema to the latest version.
- **`npm run migrate:rollback`**: Roll back the last batch of migrations, allowing you to undo recent changes to the schema.

### Example Migration

Included in this starter is a migration for setting up a `users` table, tailored to work with NextAuth. Here's what the migration scripts look like:

#### Up Migration (Create Table)

```javascript
exports.up = function (knex) {
  return knex.schema
    .createTable("users", (table) => {
      table.string("id").primary();
      table.string("name").notNullable();
      table.string("email").notNullable();
      table.string("image");
    })
    .then(() => console.log("Migration done"));
};
```

#### Down Migration (Drop Table)

```javascript
exports.down = function (knex) {
  return knex.schema
    .dropTable("users")
    .then(() => console.log("Rollback done"));
};
```

These migrations are crucial for managing the user data associated with the GitHub auth provider via NextAuth.

## Docker

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t knext .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 knext
   ```

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose for a more streamlined setup:

1. Ensure you have Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Run the following command in the project root:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This will build the image if it doesn't exist and start the container. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
